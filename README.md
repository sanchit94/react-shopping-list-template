"Cloning"(when user "clone" a list, it's appears in his account). User cannot change a template(grocery list from collection), but can apply changes to cloned version. We change a Grocery List ID and if user change Departments, Ingredients - we replace them(in order to keep main GL in save).


You can add grocery lists, you can create them from collection, or make your own list.
All ingredients are non-purchased from the begining. 
When you check ingredient(we assume you are buying it) - this ingredient get status purchased.
Purchased items will have this information: qty / Date / notes/ place where it was buyed.

Note: If we uncheck ingredient - it change it's status and removed from purchased list.

Note: we should have an ACL(Controlling data access), so user are not able to delete data of other people.

- We'll use [git-flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) so we'll not intersect between developers
- We'll use PR for pushing your code into master and I'll be a reviewer
- We'll use [bin-flow](https://github.com/facebook/flow)
- For making react components ready for cross-projects we'll use [Bit](https://bitsrc.io/).
- We'll use [Jest + Enzyme for tests](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)
- We'll use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) in order to have ability review our pages online
